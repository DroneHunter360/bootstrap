# Photopia

A static web page built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. 
I wanted a platform to showcase my photography work to others, and decided to build a website myself. Photopia is a responsive site built with a mobile-first design in mind. Using knowledge of Bootstrap, media queries, and various grid models such as flexbox, I've been able to render the website responsive to media devices of all types (i.e. phones, tablets, desktops, etc.). In the future, I hope to expand Photopia into a web application that acts more as a social platform for everybody and allows you to create your own Photopia account and share your creations with others.
